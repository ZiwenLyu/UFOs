# UFOs

## Overview of Project
This project is to assist a data journalist to display her report with a detailed and interactive data table on a web page. Her report is about the UFOs discovered in the United States. The dataset contains 7 characteristics: date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments. I will use html and JavaScript to build and format the web page, and create a table of UFOs records. Visitors can easily access data as they want to see in the table by applying mulitiple criteria: date, city, state, country, and UFO shape.

## Results
As shown from the graph, there are five filters: Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. Visitors can type their conditions according to the format shown in the input area. For instance, here we enter state "ca" and shape "light" as our conditions, then press Enter, the table with the data we want will be generated automatically and displayed in the right area.

If visitors want to do another research, they just clear out all the filters and input their new key words again, and press Enter.

## Summary
The table fulfills the function to filter data by users' input and display the table automatically to users. One thing to improve will make it even easier: users have to type Enter each time when they input conditions, also if they want to clean the filters to do new searches, they have clean each filter box one by one and then press Enter. So for the further development, I will recommend to add two more interactive functions to provide friendlier experience: one is a buttion for users to click and filter the data, anotehr one is to clear all the filters with one click.
